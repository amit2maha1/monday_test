# monday.com App Setup and Deployment Guide

This guide outlines the steps to set up and deploy a monday.com app, including a Node.js backend integration and a React.js item view feature.

## Prerequisites

* A monday.com developer account.
* Node.js and npm installed on your development machine.
* A tunneling solution (e.g., ngrok, Tunnelmole) to expose your local development server to monday.com.
* Basic understanding of React.js and Node.js.

## Steps to Run the App

1.  **Create a monday.com Application**

    * Go to your monday.com account.
    * Navigate to the "Developers" section.
    * Create a new app.
    * Configure your app's basic information (name, description, etc.).
    * For more detailed instructions, refer to the official monday.com documentation:
        * [What is a monday app?](https://developer.monday.com/apps/docs/what-is-a-monday-app)
        * [Planning your app](https://developer.monday.com/apps/docs/planning-your-app)
        * [Create an app](https://developer.monday.com/apps/docs/create-an-app)

2.  **Create Backend (Node.js Integration) and Frontend (React.js Item View) Features**

    * **Backend (Node.js Integration):**
        * In your monday.com app settings, create a new feature of type "Integration".
        * Choose a template (or start from scratch) for your integration.  This will handle the server-side logic of your app.
        * You'll need to define the integration's recipes, which consist of triggers and actions.
        * For guidance, see:
            * [Integrations](https://developer.monday.com/apps/docs/integrations)
            * [Quickstart guide - Integration](https://developer.monday.com/apps/docs/quickstart-integration)
        * Consider using monday code: [Get started - monday code](https://developer.monday.com/apps/docs/quickstart-guide-for-monday-code)
    * **Frontend (React.js Item View):**
        * In your monday.com app settings, create a new feature of type "Item View".
        * Choose a React.js template (e.g., "Quickstart - ReactJS") or create your view from scratch.
        * This will be the user interface that appears within a monday.com item's updates section.
        * See these resources:
            * [Views](https://developer.monday.com/apps/docs/views)
            * [Quickstart guide - What is a monday app?](https://developer.monday.com/apps/docs/quickstart-view)

3.  **Clone the Repository**

    * Clone the repository containing the code for your monday.com app (both the Node.js backend and the React.js frontend).
    * ```bash
        git clone <your_repository_url>
        cd <your_repository_directory>
        ```

4.  **Update API Keys and Client Secrets**

    * Obtain the necessary API keys and client secrets from your monday.com app settings.  These are crucial for authentication and authorization.
    * Store these credentials securely, following best practices (e.g., environment variables, configuration files that are not committed to version control).
    * The exact names of the variables will depend on the code in the repository, but common examples include:
        * `MONDAY_API_KEY`
        * `MONDAY_CLIENT_ID`
        * `MONDAY_CLIENT_SECRET`
    * Example using environment variables (recommended):
        * Create a `.env` file in the root of your project:
            ```
            MONDAY_API_KEY=your_monday_api_key
            MONDAY_CLIENT_ID=your_monday_client_id
            MONDAY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_monday_client_secret
            ```
        * In your Node.js backend code, use a library like `dotenv` to load these variables.

5.  **Run Backend Server and React App**

    * **Backend (Node.js):**
        * Install dependencies:
            ```bash
            cd backend
            npm install
            ```
        * Run the server:
            ```bash
            npm run start  # Or whatever the start command is in your package.json
            ```
    * **Frontend (React.js):**
        * Install dependencies:
            ```bash
            cd frontend  # Or the directory containing your React app
            npm install
            ```
        * Run the development server:
            ```bash
            npm run start  # Or npm run dev, depending on your setup
            ```
        * The React app will typically run on a local development server (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

6.  **Update Deployment URLs and Base URLs**

    * **Tunneling:** Use a tunneling solution (like ngrok or Tunnelmole) to expose your local development server to the internet. This is necessary because monday.com needs to be able to access your app.
        * Example using ngrok:
            ```bash
            ngrok http 3000  # If your React app is running on port 3000
            ```
        * ngrok will provide you with a temporary public URL (e.g., `https://your-ngrok-subdomain.ngrok.io`).
    * **Deployment URLs:** In your monday.com app settings, update the deployment URLs for your app's features (Item View, Integration) to point to the URL provided by your tunneling service.  This tells monday.com where to find your app's code.
    * **Base URLs:** Ensure that any base URLs within your application code (both frontend and backend) are also correctly set, especially for API calls or routing.

7.  **Promote the App**

    * Once you've thoroughly tested your app, you can promote it to make it accessible to users within their monday.com boards.
    * The promotion process may involve submitting your app for review, depending on how you intend to distribute it.
    * For more information on app distribution and the monday.com marketplace, refer to the official documentation:
        * [Submit your app to the marketplace](https://developer.monday.com/apps/docs/submitting-your-app-to-the-marketplace)
        * [App Marketplace](https://monday.com/appdeveloper/resources)

## Important Notes

* **Security:** Always handle API keys and client secrets securely.  Do not hardcode them directly into your code.  Use environment variables or secure configuration management.
* **Tunneling:** Tunneling solutions like ngrok provide temporary URLs. For production deployments, you'll need a stable, publicly accessible URL (e.g., by deploying your backend to a hosting provider).
* **monday.com Documentation:** Refer to the official monday.com developer documentation for the most up-to-date information and best practices.  The documentation is comprehensive and provides detailed guidance on all aspects of app development.  Start here: [monday Apps Framework](https://developer.monday.com/apps/)
* **Testing:** Thoroughly test your app in a development environment before promoting it to production.  Use monday.com developer tools and logging to debug any issues.
* **App Lifecycle:** Familiarize yourself with the monday.com app lifecycle, including versioning, updates, and maintenance.

By following these steps and consulting the official monday.com documentation, you should be able to successfully set up, deploy, and use your monday.com app.
